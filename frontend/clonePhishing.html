            <h1>Clone Phishing</h1>
            <p>Clone phishing is a type of cyberattack where scammers create a fake email or message that looks almost identical to a legitimate one you've received before. 
                Scammers make copies of an email you've already received and make a few changes to try and trick you or your employees.</p>
            <p>
                Usually, they'll try to get you to click on a malicious link, download malware, or provide sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.</p>

                <p>
                Messages in a clone phishing attack are never the same, but they often have similar elements.
                The message usually has wording that makes it seem like an urgent issue, and it has a malicious link or file attachment.

                    <li>Point your mouse at a link before you click to see where it really goes. Don’t click on links if you weren’t expecting them.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your phone and security programs are up to date to stay safe.</li>
                    <li>Be careful if an email doesn’t use your name, has mistakes, or urgently asks for your personal information—these can be scams.</li>

            <h1>Voice Phishing</h1>
            <p>Scammers pretend to be from a trusted place like your bank, the IRS, or a delivery service. 
                They may call you from a toll-free number or use special technology to sound real. 
                They try to trick you into giving personal information like your passwords, credit card, or bank details. 
                Scammers can then use this information to steal your money or identity.<p>
                Usually, they'll try to get you to click on a malicious link, download malware, or provide sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.</p>

                    A more common smishing attack uses brand names with purported links to the brand’s site. 
                    Usually, an attacker tells the user that they’ve won money or provides a malicious link for tracking packages

                <ol class="gradient-list">
                    <li>Did you hang up on a call when you realized it wasn’t a real person? Don’t worry, you’re not being rude. Robots don’t have feelings, so it’s okay. Just hang up and go about your day.</li>
                    <li>Don’t respond to voice prompts. Don’t press 1, press 3, or say “yes” to speak to an operator.</li>
                    <li>Verify the caller’s identity. Ask for their name, then call back using the official number from the company’s website. Never call back using a number they give you.</li>
                    <li>Never share sensitive information over the phone. Remember, government agencies, banks, or credit card companies will never ask for your personal information over the phone.</li>

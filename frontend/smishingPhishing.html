            <h1>Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h1>
            <p>Smishing is a type of scam that happens through text messages on your phone. 
                Scammers try to trick you into giving personal information, like passwords or bank details. 
                Sometimes they use fake websites or bad apps to help with their scam. 
                This can happen on regular text messages or other messaging apps you use on your phone.</p>
            <p>
                Usually, they'll try to get you to click on a malicious link, download malware, or provide sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.</p>

                    <li>Even replying with “STOP” can let scammers know your number is active. Just ignore the message.</li>
                    <li>If a message seems urgent, be cautious—it could be a scam. Take your time before doing anything.</li>
                    <li>If you're unsure, call your bank or company directly using official contact info. They don’t ask for personal details over text.</li>
                    <li>Don’t use any links or phone numbers from suspicious texts. Always go to the company’s official website or contact line.</li>

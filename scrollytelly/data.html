                        Between January 2020 and June 2024, approximately 120,000 scams 
                        targeting senior Australians were reported. Over this period, the 
                        number of reported scams has risen significantly each year, highlighting 
                        the increasing sophistication and adaptability of scammers. 
                        Scammers continuously develop new strategies to exploit 
                        the vulnerabilities of senior Australians, often taking advantage of their 
                        trust and limited familiarity with digital technologies.

                        Over the past few years, scammers have been increasingly preying on
                        the elderly, with reports of scams involving Australians aged 65 and
                        over surging. This growing trend highlights the need for greater
                        awareness and education among seniors to protect themselves from
                        these malicious activities.

                        Among the various types of scams, phishing stands out as the most
                        prevalent threat to senior Australians. These scams, which cunningly
                        mimic legitimate communications to steal personal information, have
                        caused significant distress and financial losses among the elderly.

                        </div>
                        In an era where everyone has an email address and mobile, scammers
                        have increasingly turned to emails, phone calls and text messages as
                        their weapons of choice. For seniors, a simple email or text can
                        lead to devastating financial losses, as these messages often appear
                        harmless but are designed to deceive.

                        </div>
                        While no part of Australia is immune to scams, certain states like
                        New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland have emerged as hotspots
                        for fraudulent activities targeting seniors. This geographical
                        disparity is likely linked to specific states having higher
                        populations and commercial activity.

                        When it comes to targeted scams, gender can influence the experience 
                        of senior Australians. While men may be reporting certain types of scams 
                        more frequently, it’s important to consider that women may either report 
                        less or be more adept at avoiding scams altogether. This highlights the need 
                        for awareness campaigns tailored to the unique risks and behaviors associated 
                        with each gender.

                        For many seniors, the financial impact of falling victim to a scam
                        can be devastating, wiping out savings and causing long-term
                        financial insecurity. The sheer magnitude of the losses reported
                        highlights the ruthless nature of these scams and the urgent need
                        for protective measures. In over 300 reported cases, senior
                        Australians have lost over $1 million.

                        Scammers don't take a holiday—if anything, their efforts stay
                        consistent year round. Senior Australians need to consistently be
                        cautious, as any day can quickly turn into despair with just one
                        wrong click.

                        As awareness about scams grows, so too does the number of reported
                        incidents. The data likely represents just the tip of the iceberg,
                        as many seniors may not report scams due to shame, embarrassment, or
                        simply not realising they've been scammed.

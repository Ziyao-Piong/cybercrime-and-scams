        <div class="title">Scam Trends Among Senior Australians</div>
        From January 2020 to June 2024, over 120,000 scams targeting senior Australians have been reported. 
        <br><br>
        During this period, the frequency of reported scams has increased significantly year over year, reflecting the growing sophistication 
        and adaptability of scammers. These malicious actors continually devise new tactics to exploit the vulnerabilities of older Australians, 
        preying on their trust and often limited familiarity with digital technologies.
        <br><br>
        The escalating trend in scam reports underscores the urgent need for heightened awareness, education, and protective measures to safeguard 
        our senior population from these evolving threats.

        <div class="title">Rising Scam Incidents</div>
        Over the past few years, scammers have been increasingly preying on the elderly, with reports of scams involving Australians aged 65 
        and over surging. This growing trend highlights the need for greater awareness and education among seniors to protect themselves from 
        these malicious activities.

        <div class="title">Dominance of Phishing Scams</div>
        Among the various types of scams, phishing stands out as the most prevalent threat to senior Australians. These scams, which 
        cunningly mimic legitimate communications to steal personal information, have caused significant distress and financial losses 
        among the elderly.

        <div class="title">Email and Mobile as the Primary Contact Mode</div>
        In an era where everyone has an email address and mobile, scammers have increasingly turned to emails, phone calls and text messages as their weapons of choice. 
        For seniors, a simple email or text can lead to devastating financial losses, as these messages often appear harmless but are designed 
        to deceive.

        <div class="title">Geographical Concentration in Certain States</div>
        While no part of Australia is immune to scams, certain states like New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland have emerged as hotspots for 
        fraudulent activities targeting seniors. This geographical disparity is likely linked to specific states having higher populations and commercial activity.

        <div class="title">Gender Differences in Scam Victimisation</div>
        When it comes to targetted scams, gender plays a role in the experience of senior Australians. Men, in particular, 
        have been found to be targetted more significantly in certain types of scams, highlighting a need for awareness 
        campaigns that address the specific risks faced by each gender.

        <div class="title">High Financial Impact of Scams</div>
        For many seniors, the financial impact of falling victim to a scam can be devastating, wiping out savings and causing long-term 
        financial insecurity. The sheer magnitude of the losses reported highlights the ruthless nature of these scams and the urgent need 
        for protective measures. In over 300 reported cases, senior Australians have lost over $1 million.

        <div class="title">Seasonal Trends in Scam Reports</div>
        Scammers don't take a holidayâ€”if anything, their efforts stay consistent year round. Senior Australians need to consistently be 
        cautious, as any day can quickly turn into despair with just one wrong click.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Role of Awareness and Reporting</div>
        As awareness about scams grows, so too does the number of reported incidents. The data likely represents just the tip of 
        the iceberg, as many seniors may not report scams due to shame, embarrassment, or simply not realising they've been scammed.
